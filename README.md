This app generates a random integer number between 1 and 20 that the user should guess. It updates the UI every time the user makes his guess, telling him whether he guessed the number correctly or not and keeping track of his score and highscore (user highest score).

Besides, the user can reset the game to its initial values. To do it, he just need to click on the 'Again!' button.
